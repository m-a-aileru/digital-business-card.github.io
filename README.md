DIGITAL BUSINESS CARD


[What is it?]

This is simply exactly what it says on the tin (or, in this case, README file) - it's a digital business card. 

[How does it work?]

Well, ideally it would be sent to you in some way, shape or form and you simply read the information (about me, of course) on it. Almost like giving you a business card in real-life, only with this one you can visit my portfolio site, contact me via email and/or LinkedIn, or visit my social media pages on Twitter, Facebook, Instagram or GitHub (GitHub isn't social media, or is it? Ah, you know what I mean). That said, you can't as of yet do any of those things listed so the links just go to the original sites or are currently dummy links. It is a prototype assignment, after all.

[Who made it?]

I did, of course ('I' being Matthew Aileru).

[Where does it come from?]

It came from a solo project assignment from Module 13 (at the time of writing as they are almost always updating the curriculum) of 'The Front-End Developer Career Path' offered by Scrimba.

[Why does this exist?]

It was built for the sheer purpose of practising what I've learnt about React up to this point in time, so a good static page project to do from scratch without any hand-holding or training wheels. 

[Anything else?]

Well, there are 3 other designs for the digital business card so an update including those will be on the horizon in the future. This project might also have sparked the idea of a far more useful a deeper reaching app for later on. Something along the lines of a 'Digital Business Card Maker' or something? I don't know, we'll see...
